Project Gap Flow: A Semantic Context Recycling Protocol for Large Language Models
​Description:
As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale, the computational cost and energy consumption of redundant processing have become a significant bottleneck. This paper/project introduces the Gap Flow Protocol, a sustainable architectural framework designed to mitigate "contextual entropy."
​Unlike traditional systems that discard logical residues after a session termination or task failure, Gap Flow implements a three-layer pipeline—AI Gap, Cloud Manager, and AI Stopped—to capture, refine, and store "Logical Sugar" (anonymized semantic essence). By shifting the paradigm from linear processing to a circular economy of logic, the protocol enables AIs to "thaw" previously refined contexts, significantly reducing GPU overhead and improving response accuracy through thematic continuity.
​This repository provides the conceptual framework and a functional Python simulation of the recycling loop, demonstrating how "waste" can be transformed into a high-value computational asset.
