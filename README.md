## Concept: GapFlow captures and recycles “logical sugar” — the useful reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) that would otherwise be lost after session failures or incomplete tasks.
Goal: Reduce computational waste, improve efficiency, and enable AI systems to learn from their own partial successes.

## Why GapFlow Matters?
Efficiency: Stop burning GPU cycles on tasks that are partially solved.
Knowledge Liquidity: Logical context becomes reusable across sessions and models.
Scalability: The more the system processes and fails, the more “sugar” it collects.
Privacy by Design: Only semantic logic is stored; no user IDs or sensitive data are kept.
How It Works (3-Layer Architecture).

AI Gap (Collector): Captures raw logical residue at session termination or error.
Cloud Manager (Refinery): Cleans, anonymizes, and tags logic for safe reuse.
AI Stopped (Vault): Stores context for future sessions, retrievable on demand.

LLM → AI Gap → Cloud Manager → GapFlow Cloud → AI Stopped → Next Session


## Key Features
Reuse of partial reasoning and failed session logic.
Modular, extensible pipeline for any LLM model.
Semantic tagging and thematic organization of logic.
Interactive simulation for testing and demonstration.
Metrics ready: track efficiency gains and context reuse.

## Potential Applications
Companies managing costly LLM pipelines (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face).
SaaS platforms leveraging LLMs for content generation (Notion AI, Jasper, Grammarly).
Research labs needing reusable context in simulations, mathematics, or optimization.
Any AI-heavy workflow where time, computation, and context retention matter.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
Copiar código
Bash
git clone https://github.com/reinhardtmarta/GapFlow.git
Open GAPFlow_project.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Run the interactive cells to see the “Logical Sugar” recycled in real time.
